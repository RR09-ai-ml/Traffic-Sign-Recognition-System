# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System
The Traffic Sign Recognition System is a computer vision project that uses deep learning to detect and classify traffic signs in real-time for autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems.

This project aims to develop a computer vision-based solution for detecting and classifying traffic signs from images or video streams. This system is designed to help autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and traffic monitoring applications by accurately recognizing various traffic signs such as stop signs, speed limits, yield signs, and more. Using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system is trained on large datasets like the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) to classify traffic signs in real-time. The model processes images by performing tasks like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance its ability to generalize to different environments. Once deployed, the system can identify traffic signs in real-time from a vehicleâ€™s camera feed, providing critical information for navigation or alerting drivers to important road signals. The project addresses challenges such as variable lighting, weather conditions, and sign occlusion, with the ultimate goal of improving road safety and enabling autonomous driving technologies.
